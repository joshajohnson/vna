A vector network analyser capable of measuring S\textsubscript{11} and S\textsubscript{21} over a 25 â€“ 1250 MHz frequency span was designed, assembled, and calibrated. Through comparison against commercially available solutions, it is shown that there are a number of issues with the measured waveforms, which impact the accuracy of magnitude measurements, along with causing significant issues with phase measurements. The design decisions causing these errors are identified, and suggestions are made to resolve them such that a second revision of the design would result in a VNA meeting the design specifications.
