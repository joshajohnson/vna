\textbf{COTS} - Commercial Off-The-Shelf

\textbf{DUT} - Device Under Test. With reference to a VNA, the device connected to VNA's ports being measured. 

\textbf{ISM} - Industrial Scientific Medical

\textbf{PCB} - Printed Circuit Board. 

\textbf{PCBA} - Printed Circuit Board Assembly.

\textbf{RF} - Radio Frequency.

\textbf{S-parameters} - Scattering Parameters. Elements of a scattering matrix which describe the behaviour of linear electrical networks. 

\textbf{S\textsubscript{MN}} - S-paramater describing the relationship between ports M and N in an electrical system. Common s-parameters are S\textsubscript{11} which represents the reflected power incident on port one, and S\textsubscript{21}, which represents the gain of a DUT between ports 2 and 1.  

\textbf{VNA} - Vector Network Analyser. Electronic test and measurement instrument which measures s-parameters of electrical networks.
